BE --> JS  --> executes in two places 
1 browser 
2 node js 

node.js : runtime environment for javascript to executes code inside computer
nodejs build on v8 engine made by google .

# Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is developed by Google and is also used in Google Chrome. V8 is known for its speed and efficiency in executing JavaScript code, making it a popular choice for powering server-side applications with Node.js. This combination allows developers to write server-side code using JavaScript, the same language used for client-side scripting in web browsers.

note : nodejs --> runtime environment

install of node js  
website : nodejs.org  --> download --> LTS (Long-Term Support) version 

to check nodejs install or not  : 
1 open cmd and  type node --version 
2 with nodejs npm(node package manager) is also come with node js 
to check npm  npm  version  type -- > npm --version

note : To open REPL inside cmd simply type -->  node and  press enter

this REPL executes all javascript code.


Introduction to JavaScript --> 
    javascript is programming language
    browser renders Frontend 
    JavaScript mainly use to make website Dynamic 


History of js : --> 
1 1995 js born  
2 js handed to ECMA in 1996
3 mozilla join js in 2005 --> ECMA5
4 94% use js  in 2016 


features of js : 
javascript is single threaded language 


java is  multi-threaded programming language  
ex : analogs to hotel ex : 
hotel  with  multi-table and multiple worker  . 

javascript is  like  : hotel with  multi-table and single waiter/worker -->
because of javascript is single threaded programming language there is concept called as asynchronous programming which make it fast with  single thread 

applications of javascript : 
1 Frontend 
2 Desktop  app using electron framework 
3 Backend development 
4 Game development
5 Machine Learning 
6 mobile app (react native )
7 iot (internet of things)


Learning of language analogs to life of person 

born --> name(giving name to baby ) ---> make baby aware about family type(brother , sister etc ) --->  teach comparisons(who best) ---> conditionals (mark > 19 ) go to garden --->repetitive things/work ---> learn how to reuse things ---> real world interactions /relation ship  --->Learning form mistakes   


js(install of nodejs  ) --->variables ---> data types --->operators (athematic , logical  ,assignment  , comparisons ,bitwise  ) --->   conditions (if/else) ---> loops --->functions  --> oops ---> exception handling 


variable => place to store data 
ex : mom places mixture-spices , grains , wheat in small 
container with specific label mark on it . 
label like  --> turmeric powder  ,sugar 

code ---> variable.js 


DataTypes ==> 
1 primitive  2 non-primitive

primitive : simple /immutable(not changeable )
8 data type in primitive 


non-primitive : complex/ mutable (changeable )
object in non-primitive

code in dataType.js



operators in javascript : 

4 + 5  == 7 

+ ===> operator 
4 ,5 ==>operand 
4+5 ===> 7 ==> operation   

code in operation.js


conditionals  ===> make decisions base on conditions 
code in conditions.js'


loops ==> 
In JavaScript, loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met

code is in loops.js
