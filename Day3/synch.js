Certainly! Here's a rewritten version of the explanation:

The code provided demonstrates the flow of execution in JavaScript using the call stack:

**1. Global Execution Context:**

- Initially, the code begins by creating a global execution context, where all globally declared variables and functions reside. In this case, only the `console.log` function is global.
- The first line `console.log("hello from first line");` executes within this global context, logging the message to the console.
- Initially, the call stack is empty, and then the global context is pushed onto the stack.

**2. Invoking the `hello` Function:**

- Upon calling `hello()`, a new execution context is created for it. This context includes any arguments passed to the function (none in this case) and any variables declared within the function (there are none here).
- Consequently, the call stack now contains two contexts: the global context at the bottom and the `hello` function's context on top.
- Inside the `hello` function, the `console.log("Hello from inside function");` statement executes, printing its message.

**3. Exiting the `hello` Function:**

- As the `hello` function completes its task, its execution context becomes unnecessary and is thus removed from the call stack, leaving only the global context.

**4. Final `console.log` Statement:**

- The final line `console.log("hello from last line");` executes within the global context, printing its message to the console.
- Subsequently, the global context itself is removed from the call stack, signifying the end of the program's execution.

**Visualization of the Call Stack:**

```
Before calling hello():
[Global Context]

After calling hello():
[Global Context]
  [hello function context]

After hello() finishes:
[Global Context]
```

**Key Points:**

- The call stack operates according to the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, where the most recently called function is the first one to be removed upon completion.
- Each function's execution context encapsulates relevant information such as local variables and arguments.
- Proficiency in understanding the call stack is vital for effective JavaScript coding and debugging, enabling developers to trace the flow of execution and identify potential errors.
